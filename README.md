# Construction_Cost_Estimation_using-ML
This project predicts construction costs using machine learning models trained on building features such as location, size, floors, and materials. The pipeline covers data preprocessing, EDA, model training, and evaluation with algorithms like Linear Regression, Random Forest, Decision Tree, and Gradient Boosting. The best-performing models achieved <100 MSE/MAE with >75% accuracy, with Random Forest and Gradient Boosting showing the most reliable results. Built with Python, Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, and Matplotlib, this project highlights the use of ML in cost forecasting and construction planning.
